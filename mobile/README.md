# Wallet App ðŸ‘‹

This is a [Expo](https://expo.dev) wallet application created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables

   **Option A: Use the setup script (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```

   **Option B: Manual setup**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

   ```bash
   # Clerk Configuration
   CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key_here

   # Google OAuth Configuration
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret_here
   ```

   **Important**: 
   - Never commit the `.env` file to version control. It's already included in `.gitignore`.
   - Get your Clerk publishable key from your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/)
   - Get your Google OAuth credentials from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Run `npm run validate-env` to check if all environment variables are set correctly

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Features

- **Authentication**: Google OAuth integration with Clerk
- **Transaction Management**: View and manage wallet transactions
